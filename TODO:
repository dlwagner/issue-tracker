-- email box on create user form does not handle special chars.
-- all users list does not sort. add sorting to user_list.pug (use issue_form.pug as example)
    --also, userController.js sorts users in the find function, but maybe that is not enough?

--date displays one day early on all issues list. I fixed this in local-library. Use same fix here.


--on update issue, date does not show up. FIX THIS! (FIXED) Added new virtual to model.
